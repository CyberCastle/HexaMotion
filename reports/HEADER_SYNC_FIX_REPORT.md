# Header-Implementation Synchronization Fix

## Issue Resolved

Fixed a TODO comment in `locomotion_system.cpp` line 804 that indicated missing method declarations in the header file. The following methods were implemented but not declared in `locomotion_system.h`:

### Methods Added to Header

1. **`setBodyPoseSmooth(const Eigen::Vector3f &position, const Eigen::Vector3f &orientation)`**

    - Sets body pose using smooth trajectory interpolation
    - Equivalent to OpenSHC's smooth movement functionality
    - Returns `bool` indicating success/failure

2. **`setBodyPoseImmediate(const Eigen::Vector3f &position, const Eigen::Vector3f &orientation)`**

    - Sets body pose immediately without trajectory interpolation
    - Provides direct pose control for compatibility
    - Returns `bool` indicating success/failure

3. **`isSmoothMovementInProgress() const`**

    - Checks if a smooth movement trajectory is currently in progress
    - Returns `bool` indicating trajectory status
    - Useful for coordinating movement commands

4. **`resetSmoothMovement()`**
    - Resets any active smooth movement trajectory
    - Allows immediate stopping of interpolated movements
    - Returns `void`

## Changes Made

### locomotion_system.h

-   Added public method declarations for all four smooth movement methods
-   Added comprehensive documentation comments for each method
-   Positioned methods logically in the smooth trajectory configuration section

### locomotion_system.cpp

-   Uncommented the method implementations (removed TODO block)
-   Added descriptive comment block for the smooth movement methods section

## Verification

Created and executed `test_smooth_movement.cpp` which verifies:

-   All methods are accessible and callable
-   Methods integrate properly with the LocomotionSystem
-   Error handling works correctly
-   Progress tracking functionality operates as expected

## Integration

-   Updated `tests/Makefile` to include the new test
-   All existing tests continue to pass
-   No breaking changes to existing API

## OpenSHC Equivalence

These methods provide equivalent functionality to OpenSHC's servo interpolation system:

-   Smooth trajectories match OpenSHC's movement interpolation
-   Immediate pose setting provides direct servo control compatibility
-   Progress tracking enables coordinated movement sequencing

The TODO has been successfully resolved with no impact on existing functionality.
