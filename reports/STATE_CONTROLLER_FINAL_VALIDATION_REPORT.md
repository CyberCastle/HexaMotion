## Implementation Highlights

### Core Features Validated

1. **Hierarchical State Management**

    - System States: SUSPENDED ↔ OPERATIONAL
    - Robot States: UNKNOWN → PACKED → READY → RUNNING
    - Walk States: STOPPED → STARTING → MOVING → STOPPING
    - Leg States: WALKING ↔ MANUAL (up to 2 legs simultaneously)

2. **Advanced Operational Modes**

    - **Posing Control**: X-Y, Pitch-Roll, Z-Yaw, External posing modes
    - **Cruise Control**: Time-based velocity maintenance with 3D vector control
    - **Pose Reset**: Multi-axis reset capabilities (Z+Yaw, X+Y, Pitch+Roll, All)
    - **Manual Leg Control**: Individual leg positioning with configurable limits

3. **Real-time Progress Tracking**

    - Transition step counting (current/total)
    - Completion percentage calculation
    - Error state monitoring and recovery
    - Timeout handling for state transitions

4. **Safety and Error Handling**
    - Emergency stop functionality
    - Invalid transition prevention
    - System suspension/recovery
    - Error message logging and clearing
